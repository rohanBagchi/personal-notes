# What is the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance

## Class Inheritance

instances inherit from classes (like a blueprint â€” a description of the class), and create sub-class relationships: hierarchical class taxonomies. Instances are typically instantiated via constructor functions with the `new` keyword. Class inheritance may or may not use the `class` keyword from ES6.

## Prototypal Inheritance

instances inherit directly from other objects. Instances are typically instantiated via factory functions or `Object.create()`. Instances may be composed from many different objects, allowing for easy selective inheritance.
